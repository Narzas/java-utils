	<h1>Page with an iframe</h1>
	This page has an &lt;iframe&gt; tag, but the &lt;iframe&gt; 
	does not have a src= attribute.
	<p/>
	In other words, the content of the &lt;iframe&gt; is already
	inlined into the page, and there is therefore no need to
	replace it with the content of an external page.
	<p/>
	This sentence is located just <b>above</b> the &lt;iframe&gt;.
